# MCP Protocol Developer

This project is designed to make the development, debugging, and deployment of MCP (Model Context Protocol) systems as easy and efficient as possible. It provides a simple interface for calling and interacting with MCP servers, with a clear view of the process and detailed logging to aid in debugging.

## Features

- **MCP Protocol Development**: Easily develop and implement MCP protocol connections with various services.
- **Simple Calls**: Simplify the process of invoking MCP servers and APIs with minimal setup.
- **Clear Process Visibility**: Track and monitor the entire call process, making it easy to understand what’s happening behind the scenes.
- **Easy Debugging**: Built-in tools to help you debug requests and responses, ensuring smooth integration and fast troubleshooting.
- **Effortless Deployment**: Quickly deploy and integrate tools and features from any MCP repository, allowing you to focus on the task at hand.

## Installation

To install the project, simply clone the repository and install the required dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/mcp-protocol-developer.git
cd mcp-protocol-developer
npm install  # or pip install -r requirements.txt for Python
```

## Usage

1. Configure the MCP server connection in the configuration file `config.json`.
2. Use the provided tools and libraries to interact with MCP servers or develop new ones.
3. Track each step of the process with detailed logs to ensure that everything is functioning properly.

Example usage:

```python
from mcp_protocol_developer import MCPClient

client = MCPClient(server_url="http://localhost:5000")
response = client.invoke_tool("send_message", payload={"message": "Hello World"})
print(response)
```

## Debugging

To enable debugging, set the `DEBUG=true` environment variable. This will provide detailed logs of each step of the request process, including headers, payloads, and responses.
